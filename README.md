# Picture-memory-game
#### This game was created in HTML 5, CSS 3, and JavaScript from Christ Dixon's "Fun JavaScript project".
## Modifications I made:
1. changed the waiting time from 3 seconds to 4;
2. create a smooth background colour to buttons;
3. decrease from 20 challenges to 10;
4. using different photos
5. using different colours to game area

###### That's all!
